# angular-2-block-counter

An Angular 2 with TypeScript example which demonstrates a component, a template, property binding and event binding amoungst other things. 

This version uses node modules for the resources and compiles the TypeScript into JavaScript during development.

see the [cdn branch](https://github.com/marklishman/angular-2-block-counter/tree/cdn).
